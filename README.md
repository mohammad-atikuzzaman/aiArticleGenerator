# 📰 AI Article Generator

An automated system that creates and posts engaging articles with custom-generated images directly to a Facebook page—powered by multiple AI services and orchestrated using Node.js. 

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can streamline content creation and social media automation. Every morning at 9 AM, a Node.js script kicks off a seamless workflow:

This end-to-end process runs automatically, delivering fresh, contextual content without manual effort.

## 🚀 Overview

1. **Topic Generation**: Using **Mistral AI**, the system selects a trending or compelling topic for the day.
2. **Article Writing**: Mistral AI then generates a full article based on the selected topic.
3. **Image Creation**: Key concepts from the article are extracted and sent to the **Hugging Face Image Generator AI**, which produces a relevant visual.
4. **Content Publishing**: The final article and image are published to a Facebook page using the **Facebook Graph API**.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – The backbone of the automation and integration logic.
- **Mistral AI** – For generating article topics and writing full-length articles.
- **Hugging Face Image Generator** – To generate images based on article content.
- **ImgBB Image Hosting** – To upload images made from Hugging Face Image Generator.
- **Facebook Graph API** – For posting articles and images to Facebook.

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or newer recommended)
- **Mistral AI API key** (for topic and article generation)
- **Hugging Face API key** (for image generation)
- **ImgBB API key** (for image uploading and link generation)
- **Facebook Developer account** (for Graph API access)

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone and setup the project**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd aiArticleGenerator
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

   Create a `.env` file and Copy the below and update with your values:

    ```bash
   # Site
   SITE_NAME="your-site-name"
   SITE_URL="your-site-url"

   # Mistral AI
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"

   # Hugging Face AI
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your-huggingface-api-key"

   # ImgBB
   IMGBB_API_KEY="your-imgbb-api-key"

   # Facebook
   FB_PAGE_ID="your-facebook-page-id"
   FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-facebook-access-token"
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command starts the automation workflow. It will trigger the daily cron job, generate a topic and article, create an image, upload it, and post everything to your configured Facebook page. You should see logs in the terminal indicating each step of the process.

   **Testing the Workflow Manually:**  
   If you want to test the workflow immediately (without waiting for the 9AM cron job), you can uncomment the following code in `index.js`:

   ```js
   // (async () => {
   //   await runGenerator();
   // })();
   ```

   This will run the generator instantly when you start the server.
